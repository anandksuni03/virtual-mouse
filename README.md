Start with a clear and concise title that reflects your project's purpose.

2. Description

This Python project creates a virtual mouse controlled by hand gestures using your webcam.<br>By tracking specific fingertips, it translates hand movements into cursor movement on the screen.<br> It also implements basic click gestures (left and right) based on fingertip proximity.<br> This is a great starting point for a more advanced hand gesture control system!
