1. Project Title

Start with a clear and concise title that reflects your project's purpose.

2. Description

This Python project creates a virtual mouse controlled by hand gestures using your webcam.<br>By tracking specific fingertips, it translates hand movements into cursor movement on the screen.<br> It also implements basic click gestures (left and right) based on fingertip proximity.<br> This is a great starting point for a more advanced hand gesture control system!


3. Installation

* Bullet point 1 Download the entire file<br>
* Bullet point 2 type "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the cmd<br>
* Bullet point 3 Type "python virtual-mouse.py"<br>


4. Features (Optional)

* Bullet point 1 It captures video from the webcam.<br>
* Bullet point 2 Detects hands using MediaPipe.<br>
* Bullet point 3 Tracks specific hand landmarks (index fingertip, middle fingertip, thumb tip).<br>
* Bullet point 4 Maps hand movement to cursor movement on the screen.<br>
* Bullet point 5 Implements a click gesture (left or right) based on the distance between fingertips.<br>

----I had commented to explain the function of the line of code---

---to get index points visit mediapipe documentation---
